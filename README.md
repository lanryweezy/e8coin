# üß† E8Coin ‚Äì Post-Quantum Cryptocurrency using E8/Leech Lattices

**E8Coin** is an experimental, post-quantum cryptocurrency built entirely on **exceptional high-dimensional lattice mathematics**, namely the **E8 lattice** and **Leech lattice**.

This project explores how advanced lattice structures can be used as the foundation for:
- Quantum-resistant digital signatures
- Lattice-based wallets
- Private transactions
- Post-quantum consensus mechanisms
- Verifiable computation and zero-knowledge proofs

## üîê Why Lattices?

Unlike traditional crypto (ECDSA, RSA), E8Coin uses mathematical structures that resist attacks even from quantum computers:
- **E8 Lattice**: 248-dimensional symmetry space with rich geometric/algebraic properties
- **Leech Lattice**: 24-dimensional perfect packing used for dense code theory
- **LWE/SIS**-like problems as computational foundation
